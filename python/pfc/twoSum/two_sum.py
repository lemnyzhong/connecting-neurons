# THIS IS TWO SUM
# Find a pair with the given sum in an array
# Given an unsorted integer array, find a pair with the given sum in it.
# Example: nums = [8, 7, 2, 5, 3, 1]
#          target = 10
 
#          Output:
 
#          Pair found (8, 2)
#          or
#          Pair found (7, 3)

#          or None case:
 
#          nums = [5, 2, 6, 8, 1, 9]
#          target = 12
 
#          Output: Pair not found
