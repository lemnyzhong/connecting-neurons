Develop a simple task management application. This type of project can simulate a to-do list or task tracking system, which is commonly used in various domains.

Here's a suggestion for a task management project using C++:

Project: "Task Management Application"

Description:
The task management application will allow users to create, manage, and organize their tasks. It will provide features like adding tasks, marking tasks as complete, setting deadlines, and displaying tasks based on different criteria.

Features:

Create a task class that represents a single task with properties like a title, description, deadline, and completion status.
Implement a task manager class that stores and manages a collection of tasks.
Provide options for users to add tasks with relevant details like title, description, and deadline.
Allow users to mark tasks as complete or incomplete.
Implement a search function to filter and display tasks based on different criteria such as completion status, deadline, or keyword.
Enable sorting of tasks based on criteria like deadline or priority.
Implement a feature to display an overview of pending tasks, completed tasks, or tasks due soon.
Add functionality to save tasks to a file and load tasks from a file, enabling persistence across application sessions.
Implement error handling and validation to ensure correct inputs and handle exceptional cases.
By developing a task management application, you'll gain experience in handling data structures (e.g., arrays or vectors to store tasks), implementing object-oriented concepts (classes and objects), managing collections of objects, and incorporating file input/output operations for data persistence.

Additionally, you can consider expanding the project by incorporating user interfaces (such as a command-line interface or a graphical user interface) to enhance the user experience. This will allow you to explore additional libraries or frameworks that facilitate UI development in C++, such as Qt or ncurses.
